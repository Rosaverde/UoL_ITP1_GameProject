# Seventh stage - "Final project"

The final stage of your game project is to make your Game Project awesome! This is your chance to flex your creative muscles, show off your technical skills, and produce a polished game.

Complete the base game:

- Firstly you need to make sure that your base game is fully functional and bug free. You will need to have implemented all of the following from the previous game projects:
    - Player intearaction
    - Canyons & Coins interaction 
    - A scrollable game world 
    - Score and lives counters 
    - Game over states

- The code philosophy videos "The debugger's mindset" and "Testing" will help you in your attempts to iron out any bugs. 

- Your code also needs to be competently implemented and well-presented. Review your code and check:
    - Indentation is correct
    - Whitespace (empty lines and spaces) is properly used inline comments but NOT commented out code
    - Consistent and logical variable naming
    - Good code organisation 
- You should also check for:
    - Implicitly declared variables, redundant variable declarations or assignments 
    - Appropriate use of local and global variables 
    - Array traversal is correctly implemented
    - Data structures and function design follow the prescribed scheme or a more advanced scheme that is rational in its design.
    - Conditional logic is clearly and plainly implemented. 
    - Game elements are correctly anchored

- Implement Extensions:

	- The next stage is to extend your code by adding up to three of the extensions which are demonstrated in the final topic:
	1. Add sounds Use p5.sound to add sound effects to your game. Watch the tutorial video from the topic to do this. 
	2. Create platforms Use the factory pattern to create platforms. Watch the tutorial video from the topic to do this. 
	3. Create enemies Use a constructor function to create enemies. Watch the tutorial video from the topic to do this.
